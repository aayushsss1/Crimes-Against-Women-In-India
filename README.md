# Crimes Against Women in India

This Python project aims to visualize and analyze different crimes committed against women in India. It uses various data visualization libraries to create informative plots and charts that depict the types of crimes, geographical distribution, and trends over time. Additionally, the project includes a heatmap generated using Geopandas to provide insights into the spatial distribution of these crimes.

## Introduction
